# micromet-net
A tool for analyzing Solar Orbiter / RPW electrical waveforms and classifing them as dust or no dust.

1. Load .cdf file from rpw.lesia.... 
2. Extract triggered signals and read meta data
3. Read mode info (3xmonopole, XLD1 mode, XLD1 highreq)
4. Preprocess the data according to mode
5. Calculate convolution of antenna signals with wavelet
6. Use trained CNN to predict dust/no dust
7. Outpout the CNN prediction
